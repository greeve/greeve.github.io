<h1>What is web mapping?</h1>

<p>Web mapping is the synthesis of two major technological achievements: cartography (mapping) and the World Wide Web (web).</p>

<h2>Cartography</h2>

<p>Everything that happens on earth happens somewhere. Throughout history technology has enabled societies to capture and record geospatial information (also referred to as spatial or geographic information) for the purpose of better describing the world and their place in the world. Cartography is the science or practice of drawing maps. Babylonians from 2300 B.C. used clay tablets to map their known world. Greeks made discoveries about the spherical nature of earth including roughly calculating the circumference of the earth. Romans were one of the first known civilizations to create a map depicting a road network. During the period termed the Renaissance explorers constructed maps to help survey new lands and places throughout the world. The development of the printing press and mechanical moveable type ushered in a new era enabling mass production of maps. Advancements in surveying and plotting tools for map makers (or cartographers) increased the accuracy and quality of maps. </p>

<p>From traditional cartography and mapping on clay tablets to remotely sensed data of the earth using aerial photography, methods have been developed to help create, maintain, retrieve, analyze, and share geospatial information. Advancements in computer technologies starting in the mid 20th century enabled the development of geographic informations systems (GIS). GIS can be broadly defined as any integrated collection of computer software and data used to capture, store, modify, analyze, and retrieve geospatial information. GIS is commonly comprised of six main components: hardware, software, data, procedures, the human user, and networks. Hardware refers to the computing devices that are used to run the various sets of GIS tasks and actions. This includes desktop computers, laptops, web servers, mobile phones, and tablets. The software is the set of computer instructions running on one or more devices that provides a digital interface for running GIS tasks and actions on computing devices. Examples include the web browser, desktop and server applications, or mobile apps. Data within a GIS refers to the digital representation of geographic features and attributes that GIS software encodes and decodes. The data is non-spatial tabular data tied to spatial data georeferenced to locations on earth. Spatial data can be represented in the from of vector features (points, lines, and polygons) or raster formats (rectangular grid storing data values for each position in the grid). Vector and raster data can be stored on disk in file-based formats or as items in a database. Procedures in GIS are the guidelines and rules put in place by an organization developing or implementing GIS. The people or users of GIS use the hardware, software, data, procedures, and networks to create, modify, update, and store GIS data and analyses. Communication and information sharing over computing and internet (and intranet) networks provides a backbone to the utility of GIS (Longley, Goodchild, Maguire, &amp; Rhind, 2005, p. 18-24).</p>
